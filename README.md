The plan:

1. This repository lives on my computers and in github.
2. The scripts in this repository allow for deployments, etc.
3. In hyperdev, I'll build a workflow of being able to edit there and deploy to prod.
  - This probably means a deploy hook which commits changes to github, pushes them to git, and then pushes to s3


Next steps:
 1. Make the index page basically presentable
 2. wire up allred.nyc DNS
 3. push this to github
